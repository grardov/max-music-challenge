# Senior Frontend Engineer Max Challenge

## Overview

The project is to build a React application for searching a database of artists via a REST API. The application should be built as a single-page app and routing should be employed so that the user may leave and return to the application via the current URL.

The applications should allow a user to:

- Search for artists who play a particular genre of music
- Add an artist from the results to a list of their favorites and then later navigate to the
  list
- Click on an artist to see more details about that artist as well as related artists
- Navigate between all the views

The application should have three main views, as described on the following pages. For each view there are basic wireframes showing the essence of what the page should look like and demonstrating the functionality.

There are endpoints for any of the data you might need for the application (detailed in the REST API documentation).
Feel free to be creative in your styling! Though not the primary aim of the project, CSS skills (both engaging in good practices as well as breadth of knowledge) are also something valued in this role.
